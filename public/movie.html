<h1>The best movies according to Yasir</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies off all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p>A wonderful historical movie that beautifully captures the medieval crusades and stories of courage, faith, and self-discovery.  If you love epic scenes with a blend of history, epic battles, and human values, then this movie is definitely for you.</p>
<h3>Captain Jack Sparrow</h3>
<p>Captain Jack Sparrow brilliantly brings the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series to life with his wit, humor, and reckless nature in this movie.</p>
<h3>Train to Busan </h3>
<p>The scariest Korean horror movie I've ever seen</p>
